Group automation project
        Project definition
        What is it?
        Group automation project is a group based agile exercise. In this exercise students will be part of an agile scrum team that will work on testing a web application.

        What is the purpose?
        This project intends to simulate a real-life work environment. It combines the theoretical and technical knowledge learnt during the course with hands-on experience. This way it serves to increase studentsâ€™ skills and confidence and make them successful while looking for a job as well as after they get a job.

        How exactly does it help?
        This project brings several benefits to its participants both in technical and non-technical areas. By completing this project students will experience working in an agile team, participate in all agile meetings, learn about the interactions between the different roles in a scrum team. In addition to that, students will collaborate in creating and maintaining a test automation framework.

        How will it work?
        You will be part of a scrum team. Your team will be assigned a web application. There will be different roles in the team. Based on your role, you will accomplish a range of technical and non-technical tasks. You will participate in all agile meetings. The project will continue over several sprint cycles.

        Is it real real-life experience?
        This is not an easy task to fully simulate a real-life work environment. While we wait to create an experience that is as authentic as possible, there are certain constraints and considerations. Next will talk about some of them below and we will explain how we plan to address each of them.

        _Agile is implemented differently everywhere.
        We will follow a certain model of implementing agile practices in this project. However, there is no standard way of implementing agile. While everyone has similar goals, agile is implemented differently in different companies.

        Teams will test web applications that are already developed.
        Automation is mostly done during the software development phase. But in this project teams will test applications that have already been developed. There will be no developers or development during the project.

        Certain role(s) will be fulfilled by your team mentor.
        Group mentor will act as the Scrum Master of your agile team. Based on need, they can also fill other roles such as Product Owner or Business Analyst.

        Jira board will reflect testing activities only.
        Jira is used to track the whole software development process. However due to reasons discussed above, this project only shows the testing part of the software development. As such our Jira will use a workflow and board that serves only testing purposes.

        Project documentation
        Your group mentors will act as your Scrum Master and will provide guidance throughout the project duration. In addition to that there is an extensive amount of documentation available that covers all of the aspects of the project in great detail.

        Project format
        Group Automation Project is an ongoing group activity. This project will is comprised of 2 phases and 5 sprints. Each sprint is 2 weeks.

        The first phase is made of 2 sprints and focuses on writing test cases and manual testing. The second phase is 3 sprints long and focuses on creating and maintaining a test automation framework.
        Refer to the Sprint objectives document for more details on the goals and tasks for each sprint.

        Test environment and test data
        Each team will be assigned a web-based application to work on. Each team will test the application in the testing environment. Each team will be provided with a separate documentation with the URLs and the login information. Refer to the Application information document for information on your application.

        Test cases and test plan
        Teams will study the application assigned to them and the domain where it operates. Team members will write test cases for that application that will be executed manually and/or using automation. Each team will write test cases for Smoke test and automate them. Each team will be provided a test plan document that provides details on testing approach and strategy.

        Scrum Team
        Each group will be one scrum team. Group members will act as SDETs while the group mentor will be the Scrum Master. Other roles such as PO, BA can be fulfilled by the same or other people. Refer to the Roles and Responsibilities document for more details.

        Agile workflow
        Teams will participate in all standard agile ceremonies. Scrum Master will organize and run those meetings. Agile Meeting Guide documentation will provide more details on the structure of each meeting and what is expected from team members in each meeting. The same document will give information about pointing strategy.

        Jira
        Jira will be used during the project. Each team will have their own separate project. Jira will be configured with a workflow and board custom suited for this project. Refer to the Cybertek Jira Workflow document to find out more about the custom Jira workflow. The document also describes the procedure for creating new bug stories in case a bug is found.

        Framework
        Each team collaborates to create an automation framework from scratch and add test cases to it. Tech Lead of each team will be responsible for general state of the framework. Each team will schedule their smoke tests to be executed daily with proper reporting. Framework description document provides more details about technical aspects of the framework
