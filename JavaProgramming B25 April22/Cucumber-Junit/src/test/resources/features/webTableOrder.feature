    #Iconvert my table below into scenario outline and WeCaNot do Scenario outline without provide an example table
   #xample below are given to create a Parameterization Type We ConvertInto Parameterization intoScenario Outline
   # This Step->When user selects product type "<productType>". So The mention Step does not change
  Scenario Template: User should be able to place order and order seen in web table
    Given user is already logged in and on order page
    When user selects product type "<productType>"
    And user enters quantity <quantity>
    And user enters customer name "<customerName>"
    And user enters street "<street>"
    And user enters city "<city>"
    And user enters state "<state>"
    And user enters zipcode "<zipcode>"
    And user selects credit card type "<cardType>"
    And user enters credit card number "<cardNumber>"
    And user enters expiry date "<expDate>"
    And user enters process order button
    Then user should see "<expectedName>" in first row of the web table

    #control each table when We are on Runner Class using scenario outline
    #Tata table allows us to pass collection type into a step in feature file
    #Scenario outline is completely different, It's similar approach to Parameterization. But instead of passing the
    #test data inside of the step, we provide a test data as a table under our Scenario outline
    #When You change the name on the custom name test failure due to not match at expectedName
