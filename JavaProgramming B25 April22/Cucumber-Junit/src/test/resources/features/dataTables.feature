  #@wip
  #CreateSteps 4 Parameterization passArgument in-->WikipediaStepDefinitions class & pass theArgument Inside
  # the steps -->Steve Jobs
  #For the data table We create pipe under the scenario and pass over some fruit U like scenario below
  Scenario: List of fruits I like

    #to beautify the pipes above
    #mac: command + option + L
    #windows: control + alt + L


    #Scenario below to practice is to put in DataTableSpeDe_ List of String SoI CanUse Java&Collection Logic
