==========================

Software method -> method:way of to do something , rule 

IT companies --> standard methods / rules

waterfall method --> SDLC -> step by step, 
                 no going back to the previous step + each step has tp completlly done before move to the second one. 

                     people: separately 

  EX: Football game app 

     1. build Business team --> PO, BA, PM, + the client 
           3 months for only analyze the req + prepare SRS & other documents

     2. designers -> 1. read & analyze the SRS doc 
                     2. Plan -> 4 designers + 2 months 
                     3. design the app + SDS doc 

     3. Developers -> 1. read & analyze SRS doc + SDS doc 
                      2. 7 developers --> Plan-> 6 months - 
                      3. develop the app by following the plan

     4. Testers --> 1. read & analyze SRS doc + SDS doc + the software 
                    2. 5 testers(QA+performance) -> plan : 5 months 
                    3. start to test by following the plan 

                       what if testers find bugs from the app? 
                       - testers log the bugs in bug reports. 
              
        The client is invited to accept the app, so the team can release the app. 
            
            1. bugs are not big, i want the app still released. maybe fix the bugs in maintaining. 

            2. Let's fix the bugs & then release the app. 

        Developers release the app to the market. 




    Amazon was in waterfall --> transferring the the agile 

=========================================

17 develoeprs -> work as a team with all the people for the the project
                 invite the client on each step of SDLC
                 get feedback often 
                 work on a small part of the app at a time -> deliver the app on the market faster , frequently 
                 welcome change 

new software method / rule -> Agile


Agile -> branches/ frameworks/ types 

         Agile - Scrum -> complex projects 
                   Scrum role in a Scrum team -> PO, SM, Dev team 
                   Sprint - 2 week - 4 weeks
                   Scrum meetings - 5


         Agile - Kanban 
                  a team -> business members, designers, testers, develoeprs, client
                  10 user stories -> meet with the client 
                      - 2 weeks 
                      - 3 weeks 
                      - 8 days 



         Agile - XP, LEAN, Crystal

=============================

Agile - Scrum: 

What is Scrum? -> Scrum 3 roles, 3 artifacts, 5 meetings

Sprint -> time box , fixed 
          
          1 sprint =  1 week
          1 sprint =  2 weeks ---> the most common sprint cycle 

              some req -> design - develop - test in 2 weeks => meet with the client

          1 sprint =  3 weeks
          1 sprint =  4 weeks  


brak till 12:20pm 


The po wrote the US on Feb/10 for Sprint 1  (march 1 - 12).

Scrum master -> master on Scrum, coach the team about the scrum meetings, guide the team to follow the scrum rules, facilitator, 


srs vs user story 

PO with all the BT member
srs -> document with all the functions of the app


PO 
user story -> 1 sentence 
               
              As a user, I want to <1 function> so that I get a <benefit>


All the user stories that PO wrote for 1 sprint a time , all of them are listed under the Product backlog. 
    
backlog - list of work that are waiting to be done
