Agenda: 
    - Quick review testing types

    - Regression testing : why? when? how many scenario/test cases? how long to run?
         - Parallel testing

    - Smoke testing: why? when? how many scenario/test cases? how long to run?

============================
Sprint 1 : 10 user stories 
           
            1 dev -> 1 story(delete files) -> code is done to develop the function 

                     unit testing -> in the Dev env

                     integration testing -> in the Dev env


            1 QA -> the delete files function -> functional testing 

                     UI testing 
                     DB testing 
                     API testing

==============================

Business team -> inform the QAs about the release plan: release due date? 
                                                        release cycle
                                                        features 

EX: amazon -> project : 1.5 years , released 7 times 

             how many regression is performed in the last 1.5 years? 
              - regression testing is performed for 7 times 
              - because the regression testing is done right before the release


Regression testing can divide into 2 parts: 

1. small / minor regression -> at the end of each sprint
                               only the TC created during the sprint is AUTOMATED

2. big / major regression -> before the release 
                             both manual & automation testing is performed 



can you tell me about your regression? 

- what is regression in 1 sentence 
- we perform the Regression before each release - our release cycle is: 3/4/month
          - small/minor Regression is performed at the end of each sprint

- how many total scenarios you have : 500 -- 3000 scenario
- automation : run it with 2---6 VM + takes 30 minutes --- 4 hours 
- manual testing -> 20% of the total TC -> around a week of time 

=============================

smoke test rule: 
     1. quick execution -> less amount of TC 
     2. max 30m 
     3. run the smoke test TCs every morning  

Release 1(S1--S4) : 04/30

sprint 5: 8 user stories 
        
         1 day: all the QAs conduct a meeting: select TC for the smoke test 
          

          90 TC -> positive TC + major functions TC + enough to evaluate the entire feature is working fine 

          smoke test ==> 10 TC/scenarios -> @smoke tag name

          schedule for the smoke test: 5am / 6/ 7/ 8/9 AM

          after the meeting, QA lead provide the info to the DevOps team 

          devOps team: create a smoke test job from Jenkins app



QA -> intelliJ + click run button -> result of the code

Jenkins -> GitHub + @smoke codes -> VM -> run the code  -> result send to your email
