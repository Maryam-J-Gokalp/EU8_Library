   STLC step 3: Test Case creation 


[ Note: Next week, each group conducts a meeting: Project initial prep meeting

      Team name, Sprint cycle, Scrum meeting schedule, DOR/DOD, etc ]

===================================

is STLC steps for the whole project or for just one User Story? 
------------------


STLC 1st step: req analyze

As a student, I want to watch a recording_UI(DB/API). 

1. which function am I going to test? 

2. is it UI? DB? API? 

3. Testing approach? manual? automatically? both? 

     case: Only manual. becasue the automation tool is not avaliable to automate the function. EX:bar code, download file

     case: Only automation. 85-90% auto -- 10-15% manual 

     case: both manual & automation. deoends on your role & responsibility. 


STLC step 2: Test plan creation 
             
             What is a test plan? who writes Test plan document? 
             - is a doucment -> QA team planning scheule, test strategy - tools/scop, recourses, risk & mitigation, someone from the business team approves the doc.   

            who writes Test plan document?  
             - test lead 
             - I create the test plan doc. 


     waterfall -> a group of testers test the whole project at once. 

                   SRS, SDS, QA env 

                   meeting: Test plan discuesstion 


                   Test lead is taking note from the meeting, then he/she will write the test plan doc . 


                    due date: 2/01 ---> 08/01 

                    recourses:
                    human : list names of the testers 
                    software : discord, jira, vm, IDES, aws, jenkins ....
                    hardware: computer, monitor , 

              Test stratgegy?
                  1. testings types == testing scop  -> Select from the test level

                     System testing: Func-> UI, DB, API, Smoke, rgression, 
                                     Non-Func -> strees, capacity, volume, etc

                     UAT: Beta testing -> the client , end users
                          


                    2. testing tools 
                    3. Environment 


               Risk & Mitigation: possible problems & solution 



               after the test plan contant discusstion meeting, QA lead wirte the test plan doc -> QAs have another meeting to review the docuemnt -> then submit the doc to the business team to approve it. 
               note: QAs are performing static testing in this situation. 
                



     Agile -> 1 testers test 1 function at a time. 

             in Agile, it is optional to make a test plan document. 

             In Scrum, some teams think that since there is sprint plan for each sprint, having test plan is taking extra time. so they do not have any. 

             There are teams they do have test plan documents.
             Most of the times, the teams have Release level test plans. 

                release v1.0 -> Feb -> May --> ABC functions

                QAs prepare one test plan contant in a meeting. QA lead can write the test plan.  


                release v2.0 -> May -> Aug --> DEF functions
                 QAs prepare one test plan contant in a meeting. QA lead can write the test plan.  





code review -> a meeting , at the end of each sprint. 
               QAs review each other's code. 



========================================


As a student, I want to watch a recording so I can review the calss. 

 
   the US will be assigned to a QA. 

   step1: The QA will create test case document. 

   step2: the QA will write test script == code. 

   step3: manual & automation execution starts. 


-------------------------

     where is the "waching recording function"? 


test case -> 
     ID: 001 
     discription: users can watch recording 

    a user in on the dashbaord
    the user click a course    -> data: name of the course 
    the user clicks a recording  -> data: name of the recording
    then user should be able to watch the recording successful 

   environemt: qa.canvas.com





Sprint1 -> 1 qa tested the login function 


after sptint6 there is a release -> regression tetsing -> manually test all the US & its test cases one more time before release. 

-----------------------------

STLC step3 : test case creation 

         Each QA creates at least 1 Test case for each US. 

         Test case includes: 

          ID -> number

          descriotion  -> phrase, short sentence 

          steps -> details steps , 



How do you document your test case? 
  
   - Project management tool/app -> jira, radar, rally, Bugzilla, etc 

   - excel sheet 


US 1-> 3 TC 
   
   BOA1
   BOA2
   BOA3

US 2-> 2 TC
   
   BOA4
   BOA5

US 2-> 5 TC
   
   BOA6
   BOA7
   BOA8
   BOA9



As a user, I want to login. 

AC: 1. Admin login -> 3 modules : A,B, C
    2. Student login -> 2 modules : A,B 
    3. There should be a user input box above the password, 
    4. "Sign in"  button with blue background is 


4: 20 pm 
---------------------------------

Interview question: in the zoom interivew

1. write test cases for the FB login page. 

     - production env 

     - no data is provided 



2. Write test cases for reverse string code. [asked to write the code first, then write test case to it]


**** while you are writing the test case, you do not care about the actual result. 

*** While perforing the manual & automation testing, then i WILL write the actual result, pass/fail status. 




4rth possibility that we could test : 

 user login with empity credentiasl -> warning message 
                                       The email or mobile number you entered isn’t connected to an account. Find your account and log in.



3rd possibility
valid email -> invalid password -> The password you’ve entered is incorrect. Forgot Password?
